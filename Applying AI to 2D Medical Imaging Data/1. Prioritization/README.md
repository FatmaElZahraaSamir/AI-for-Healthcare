# classification algorithms
one for the detection of brain bleeds on head CT images, and one for the detection of aortic dissection on chest x-ray images

### Dataset
1. A list of images that have come in through the ED in order of patient arrival
2. Probabilities of 'brain bleed' for each image, as determined by one of your deep learning algorithms
3. Probabilities of 'aortic dissection' for each image, as determined by one of your deep learning algorithms
